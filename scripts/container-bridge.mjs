/**
 * TCP forwarder: <container-bridge-gateway>:{8765,8766,8767,8011,8012,10255} → 127.0.0.1:{...}
 *
 * OWNERSHIP (2026-09-26): moved here from CUassistant, now Cob_advisor (scripts/mcp-public-bridge.mjs,
 * launchd com.cuassistant.mcp-public-bridge) on Chip's decision: this repo is the
 * central services provider, and the bridge is shared host plumbing for four
 * owners — mailcal (8765), this repo (8766/8767), gc_alumni (8011/8012) and
 * OneCLI (10255). Installed by deploy/install.sh as
 * edu.clemson.advising-mcp.container-bridge. Logic unchanged by the move.
 *
 * CUassistant MCP servers (and the OneCLI credential proxy) are loopback-only by
 * design (127.0.0.1). Apple Container VMs reach the host only via the bridge
 * gateway, not via 127.0.0.1. This forwarder bridges both without requiring those
 * services to bind a non-loopback interface.
 *
 * Port map:
 *   8765  — credentialed MCP server (requires Authorization bearer)
 *   8766  — public MCP server (Clemson class schedule, requires bearer)
 *   8767  — catalog MCP server (GC curriculum/degree plan, requires bearer)
 *   8011  — gc-alumni MCP server (GC alumni outcomes, no auth)
 *   8012  — gc-careers MCP server (student-facing aggregates; public ingress is Caddy)
 *   10255 — OneCLI credential proxy (containers fetch API credentials through it)
 *
 * ── Why the gateway is resolved at runtime (2026-07-10) ──────────────────────
 * Apple Container 1.0 moved the bridge subnet from 192.168.64.0/24 to
 * 192.168.65.0/24. This script hardcoded `192.168.64.1`. After the upgrade that
 * address no longer exists on any interface, so every listener here was bound to
 * a dead address: containers (now on 192.168.65.x) could reach neither the MCP
 * servers nor — worse — the OneCLI credential proxy on 10255.
 *
 * A hardcoded address is exactly what turned a documented network change into a
 * silent outage, so there is deliberately no hardcoded fallback. Resolution order:
 *   1. BRIDGE_HOST env var (explicit operator override)
 *   2. `container network inspect default` → [0].status.ipv4Gateway
 *   3. os.networkInterfaces() scan of bridge100 / bridge0
 * If all three fail we wait and retry rather than guess.
 *
 * ── Why we supervise instead of binding once ────────────────────────────────
 * The gateway interface (bridge100) exists only while the Apple Container network
 * is up. At boot, or during a quiet period with no containers, the address is
 * absent and bind() fails with EADDRNOTAVAIL. The old code called process.exit(1)
 * on any listen error, so one transient failure killed every forwarder. Each port
 * is now supervised independently and rebinds when the address appears — or
 * reappears at a different value after a runtime upgrade.
 *
 * ── Why we never bind 0.0.0.0 ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 8765 is credentialed and 10255 is a credential proxy. Binding all interfaces
 * would expose both to the campus LAN. Gateway-only is the entire point of this
 * file; widening the bind would trade a connectivity bug for a security hole.
 *
 * (8766/8767 now bind 0.0.0.0 themselves, in their own processes, behind a
 * bearer each. That is deliberate and scoped to those two servers — it is not a
 * reason to widen anything here. This forwarder is a raw TCP pipe: it copies
 * bytes between sockets and never parses or rewrites HTTP, so Authorization
 * headers pass through untouched and containers using it need no change.)

// Two cadences. A container starting the moment the gateway appears cannot

//
// This is affordable because the two checks cost very different amounts:
// addressIsLive() is a pure os.networkInterfaces() read, while
// gatewayFromRuntime() spawns `container network inspect`. Only the cheap check
// runs at FAST_MS; the declared gateway is re-read on the slow cadence, which is
// correct because it is static configuration that changes when a network is

 * being refused, and supervise()'s "gateway disappeared" branch could never
 * fire because its input never changed.
 *
 * So a declared gateway counts only while it is actually on an interface.
 * When it is not, return null and let supervise() close the listener: a
 * refused connection is a detectable failure, a hung one is not.

 * We deliberately do NOT fall back to gatewayFromInterfaces() here. A declared
